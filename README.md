# ProjectEuler
These are my attempts at solving problems on Project Euler using python. Keep in mind some of the files are works in progress. To which problems I've successfully completed, visit my profile on Project Euler. My username there is mstacky.
The file euler.py is a class containing my commonly used functions.
